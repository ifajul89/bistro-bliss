### Five features of my project

- This project is Restaurant Management Website. Users can know about us, read blogs, order foods and much more.

- This web page is built with React Router DOM. That is why it is possible to navigate multiple routes on a single page on my website without any reload.

- For all side effects Tanstack Query / React Query has been used, that made error handling, fetching and pending data load much easier.

- React Helmet has been used to make the head and title dynamic.

- JWT or JSON Web Token has been used to make the user authorization much more secure.
